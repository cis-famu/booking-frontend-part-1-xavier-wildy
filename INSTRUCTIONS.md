# Booking Frontend Part 1

**Overview**: This project builds off last the assignment where you designed the Booking API. You will create a ReactJS application that interacts with your backend API.


**Submission Instructions**:
Once you've completed the required user stories for your project, take the following steps to get your project ready to
submit.

1. Push Code to Github Repository
    - If this week's assignment is starting a new project. However, if the week's assignment is a continuation of the
      last week's project, you will NOT create a new project. Copy the project files into the new repository folder and
      make an initial commit.

2. Update README Template
    - Every submission must be accompanied by a README.md using the readme template provided with the assignment to
      demonstrate which required and optional tasks you've completed.
    - In your project repository, add a README.md file in the root directory that contains the contents of the README
      template for that assignment.
    - If the assignment is a continuation of the same project from a previous week, add the new template to the end of
      the previous README instead of creating a new file.
    - Make sure to check off the user stories you've completed.

3. GIF Walkthrough
    - Your README.md must contain a GIF walkthrough using a recording program of your choice. It should demonstrating
      how it works with the user stories completed.
    - We recommend [Kap](https://getkap.co/) for macOS, [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for Windows,
      and [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for Linux.
    - [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) is a great service for hosting the GIF walkthrough and then linking to it from
      the README.
    - When using Imgur, you can right-click on the gif and choose "Copy Image Address" to get the correct address. Make
      sure the address has a `.gif` extension. If you end up with a url that has a `.gifv` extension, removing the `v`
      and changing this to `.gif` will ensure the gif renders on GitHub.

4. Make sure you've pushed all your latest code up to GitHub
    - To check this, you can browse your repository on GitHub on your favorite browser to make sure some of your latest
      changes are present there.
